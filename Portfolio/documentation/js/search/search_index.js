full-stack applications.                   Developed applications using various technologies such as HTML, TypeScript, Java, Spring, Hibernate, and SQL.                   Applications were developed using methodologies such as Agile and SCRUM to efficiently work in team                   environments and achieve project goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            About Me              I enjoy traveling, long days by the beach, the outdoors,                 exploring and riding my dirt bike through the woods, and quality time with family.                 I also enjoy watching sports, tinkering with mechanical and electrical components,                 caring for my house plants, art drawing and painting.

We're maintaining a dedicated Support Forum for this purpose. This is also a go-to place for every suggestion, opinion, bugs, and issue reports - if you'd like to receive help as soon as possible. Reports posted on Support Forum are prior to GitHub issues.\n\nCheck available resources - always check current issues before opening your own. Also check Support Forum and Documentation - most likely you'll find your answer there. Unchecked issues and duplicates will be closed immediatelly.\n\nExamine issue source - MDB code is depending on other projects, mainly Bootstrap. Don't open issues concerning sources we cannot influence. For example - lack of flexbox support for older IE versions is determined by Bootstrap not MDB.\n\nCheck updates - We resolve most of reported bugs and issues with every new release. Check if your MDB version is the latest. You can take a look at our changelog to find if your problem wasn't already taken care of. If you want to keep track on updates and bug fixes, the best way is joining our newsletter here.\n\nBe specific - describe your case in English, clearly and with details. Attach code examples, screenshots, links and any other relevant resources.\n\n\nContributing Standards\nAll improvements, fixes and new elements are welcome and we're deeply grateful for every help attempt. Although we recommend thinking twice before starting. We don't want to waste your time and some changes may be rejected not becouse of their quality but simply as a result of different style, organization or prefifined procedures we maintain.\nThat's why we came up with standards below, following them will maximize the chance of your contribution beeing included in project.\n\nMake sure that your idea doesn't contradict the concepts of Bootstrap, Material Design and Angular\nVerify if it fits the rest of MDB envoirement and style\nWrite and form your code accordingly to those rules\nUse Gulp to minify your code after finishing\nCreate clear titles and detailed descriptions for your Pull Requests\n\nSubmitting a Pull Request\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nSearch GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\n\nFork the mdbootstrap/Angular-Bootstrap-with-Material-Design repo.\n\nMake your changes in a new git branch:\n git checkout -b your-branch-name master\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message.\n\nPush your branch to GitHub\n git push origin your-branch-name\nIn GitHub, send a pull request to Angular-Bootstrap-with-Material-Design:dev\n\n\nThank you for your contribution!\nQuestions\nIf you're not sure about your ideas or you'd like to talk about them with our team before starting, write to: contact@mdbootstrap.com, and for every query regarding technical consultance open your case on Support Forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n
